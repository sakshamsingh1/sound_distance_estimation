## SOUND SOURCE DISTANCE ESTIMATION IN DIVERSE AND DYNAMIC ACOUSTIC CONDITIONS

Official implementation of the paper :  ["Sound Source Distance Estimation in diverse and dynamic acoustic conditions"](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~iran/papers/Kushwaha_et_al_WASPAA_2023.pdf)

Accepted at WASPAA 2023

The documentation to run the experiments will be updated soon. 

The Code is based on [seld-dcase2022](https://github.com/sharathadavanne/seld-dcase2022) and [DCASE2022-data-generator](https://github.com/danielkrause/DCASE2022-data-generator)
